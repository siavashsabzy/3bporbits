# 3bporbits
In this project, the procedure for finding groups of periodic orbits in the different models of three-body problem is presented. Also, a database for periodic orbits in the three-body problem is introduced. The algorithm is a single shooting algorithm. This project will be updated to contain all types of orbits.
EM_L1_CR3BP.mat, EM_L2_CR3BP.mat, and EM_DR_CR3BP.mat are the periodic orbits database extracted from shooting algorithm.
